                        I want to avoid writing any more or anything.

                "I really need something inspiring to say and I think this is 
                one of the most inspiring things ever. It isn't all about luck
                of whatever you do. It's all about staying healthy so you have
                the energy to type forever because if you can't type in this day and
                age you might be in a little bit of a pickle. I need to type even 
                more in order to not stay in a pickle. I love typing I type so fast"
